# Daily-Planner-Scheduler

ORGANIZATION is very crucial! If you are working on a project, taking a class, or even trying to squeeze in some relaxing time around your busy schedule, then you must keep track of you time! This is very important for an individual to know how they plan on spending their time wisely. Knowing how much time to allocate to work on a particular task and then knowing when to switch to a different project, or taking an hour or so to do some light reading before you get back to the grind, an efficient person will always choose to have their hours planned ahead of time. There are even situations where you may not know HOW to allocate your time because youa re undertaking a new never before done project. Well, in that case it would be very important to keep track of how much time you are spending on this new endeavor, that way you will have a better idea of your days ahead. Either way, organizing your time and your days will always be a value add!
